## Introduction  
**get_next_line** is a C function that reads a file or input from a file descriptor, returning one line at a time. The function efficiently handles buffer management, memory allocation, and edge cases like EOF, empty lines, and multiple file descriptors.  

The goal of this project is to practice file handling, dynamic memory allocation, and using system calls like `read` in C.

---

## Features  
- **Reads file line by line**  
  - Handles input from files and standard input (`stdin`).
  
- **Memory Management**  
  - Allocates memory for each line read.
  
- **Handles Edge Cases**  
  - Manages EOF and empty lines properly.

- **Multiple File Descriptors**  
  - Works with multiple file descriptors simultaneously.

---

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
To compile and use **get_next_line**, you need:  
- GCC or any C compiler.  
- Make utility.

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/ma1loc/get_next_line.git
   cd get_next_line
